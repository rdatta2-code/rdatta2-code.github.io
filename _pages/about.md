Welcome! 
======
I am an applied economist and data scientist with a Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Washington. My expertise spans causal inference, time series forecasting, and model validation, with applications across tech, finance, and consulting.

I have delivered solutions at Amazon, Deloitte, D.E. Shaw, and Keystone AIâ€”ranging from causal forecasting and supply chain scenario planning to revenue modeling under uncertainty and regulatory stress testing. My research combines Bayesian VARs, quasi-experimental methods, and structural macro models to analyze policy and financial stability questions.

I bring a mix of academic rigor and applied experience, translating complex quantitative models into actionable insights for decision-makers in business, finance, and policy.

[Heterogeneous Asset Returns and Monetary Policy Redistribution](https://rdatta2-code.github.io/files/Heterogeneous_Asset_Returns_and_Monetary_Policy_Redistribution.pdf)
> In a distributional examination of monetary policy impacts, my study explores how changes in the federal funds rate affect short-term consumption dynamics through the wealth inequality channel. Differential returns and prices of housing and equity along with heterogeneous marginal propensities to consume out of income across households, cause uneven effects of monetary policy on individuals with different net wealth. Exploring the impacts unveils surprising results contrasting to existing literature: a 1% federal funds rate drop increases consumption of outright homeowners by more than double relative to mortgage holders (3.02% vs 1.43%), yields a 1.72% rise for older individuals with a 1.29% boost for younger ones. The middle 50-90% net wealth distribution gain nearly twice as much as the bottom 50% (1.51% vs 0.8%). The analysis unveils varying group susceptibilities to monetary policy, underscoring the diversified effects based on housing tenure, age, and borrowing constraints. Besides identifying winners and losers, I also study how the distribution affects the aggregate. A 1% reduction in the federal funds rate increases overall consumption by 1.63%. There also exists significant asymmetries at all levels with 1% increase curtailing aggregate consumption by merely 1.02%, signifying hurdles in achieving a ’soft landing.’

Portfolio Choices, Asset Prices, and Wealth Inequality (with Yu-chin Chen and Brian Greaney)
> The escalation in wealth inequality over recent decades underscores a substantial societal challenge, manifesting across both generational and racial divides. Notably, a stark disparity exists between the average wealth of households aged 20-39 and those aged 60 and above from the 1960s to 2019. Our investigation seeks to unearth the underlying mechanisms driving this trend, with a spotlight on changing asset returns as a pivotal contributor to burgeoning inequality. We meticulously explore three potential sources of disparity across birth cohorts and race: the vicissitudes of asset markets, varying levels of inheritance and debt at the outset of working life, and barriers to investment such as the costs associated with homeownership. Employing a dynamic heterogeneous-agent model, we delve into households' lifetime financial decisions, meticulously calibrating our model with the data from the Survey of Consumer Finances to scrutinize how asset returns, initial wealth, and investment opportunities collectively fuel the observed inequality trends. Our analytical journey extends to assessing the welfare effects and evaluating potential policy reforms to mitigate these entrenched disparities, aiming for a more equitable economic landscape.


[Choice of Refinancing and Hand-to-mouth Status](https://rdatta2-code.github.io/files/Choice_of_Refinancing_and_Hand_to_mouth_Status.pdf)
> What does the choice of refinancing reveal about the Hand-to-mouth (HtM) status of households? Preliminary empirical analysis from the SCF corroborates the interlinkage between household debt & HtM status. Further evidence from refinance approvals indicate strong demand for home equity extraction in periods of high unemployment often aided by higher house prices. Following Kaplan, Violante and Weidner (2014), I motivate their measurement by setting up a 3 period partial equilibrium model with heterogeneous preferences to investigate the importance of considering mortgages distinctly from other illiquid assets in the determination of HtM status. Better estimates of the same is imperative for understanding the transmission and redistributive effects of monetary policy & fiscal transfers. Simple qualitative experiments in a calibrated model strongly match the current trends in house prices, unemployment and mortgage refinancing.

* Optimal Monetary Policy in Analytical HANK framework
> I explore the impact of wealth inequality on optimal monetary policy, focusing on how it influences the inflation-output gap. Drawing from Debortoli & Galí (2018), I use an analytical HANK model to analyze consumption disparities between different economic groups and its implications for central bank policies. My study also examines the interplay of expansionary monetary and fiscal policies during the pandemic, noting a rise in wealth inequality. I highlight the limitations of the TANK model in fully capturing the heterogeneity. The paper emphasizes the need for including multiple agents who have diverse portfolio shares and borrowing constraints to better understand the qualitative impications of nuances of canonical discretionary and committment poliies in the face of complex economic realities.

* Wealth Inequality, Housing and Business Cycles in the US
> What is the role of wealth inequality in causing and amplifying business cycles & vice-versa? In particular, can we quantify the correlation between housing and estimated business cycle shocks & frictions along the lines of Bayer et al. (2020) with its subsequent impact on business-cycles & the time-varying wealth distribution ? I propose to estimate a heterogeneous-agent New-Keynesian (HANK) model in continuous time featuring two illiquid assets and gross positions for housing. The model emphasizes the
differential impacts of asset price changes suitably calibrated to match key features of the observed US wealth distribution. The constructed counterfactuals are intended to have strong implications for the redistributive role of monetary & fiscal policy in impacting the wealth-shares of both the top 10% & middle 50-90% in the post-pandemic era.

[IMF Trade Flow Forecasts for Crisis Countries: (In)Accuracies and Their Origins](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207022001042?dgcid=coauthor) <!--[[slides](https://econreinakawai.github.io/files/IMF Nowcasts_slides.pdf)]-->

<!--
> External sector surveillance and stabilization are core missions of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Since 1992, the IMF approved over 600 crisis country loan programs, conditional on reforms and performance targets that are contingent on IMF crisis assessments and recovery forecasts. The literature evaluating IMF crisis forecasts has primarily focused on GDP, inflation, and fiscal budgets, but IMF programs often originate with balance of payments crises. Our evaluation of IMF imports/exports/exchange rates in crisis countries reveals a surprising dichotomy: import forecasts are largely efficient and unbiased, while exports and exchange rate forecasts exhibit substantial biases and inefficiencies. We show forecast errors in the full sample are driven by deeply flawed IMF forecasts for LICs in crisis. Fixed exchange rate LICs (predominantly African franc zone countries) receive systematically inefficient import forecasts. Exchange rate forecasts for LICs with flexible exchange rates are so inefficient, they cannot outperform a naive random walk, and over 30 percent of the forecasts cannot match the exchange rate’s directional movement during the first year of the recovery. Examining the sources of biases and inefficiencies, we highlight effects of conditionality and geopolitics that were not fully accounted for in IMF forecasts, specifically those relating to arrears (domestic and foreign), fiscal finance (balance and credit limits), policy reforms (trade and government), (civil) wars, and elections.-->

[Public Debt and Real GDP: Revisiting the Impact](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2022/04/29/Public-Debt-and-Real-GDP-Revisiting-the-Impact-517449)
(with Constance de Soyres and Mengxue Wang)<br/>
**_IMF WP Number: 2022/076_**
> This paper provides new empirical evidence of the impact of an unanticipated change in public debt on real GDP. Using public debt forecast errors, we identify exogenous changes in public debt to assess the impact of a change in the debt to GDP ratio on real GDP. By analyzing data on gross public debt for 178 countries over 1995-2020, we find that the impact of an unanticipated increase in public debt on the real GDP level is generally negative and varies depending on other fundamental characteristics. Specifically, an unanticipated increase in the public debt to GDP ratio hurts real GDP level for countries that have (i) a high initial debt level or (ii) a rising debt trajectory over the five preceding years. On the contrary, an unanticipated increase in public debt boosts real GDP for countries that have (iii) a low-income level or (iv) completed the HIPC debt relief initiative. -->
